            <p style={{backgroundColor: "#0a10e8", marginTop: "6%", marginLeft: "3%", maxWidth: "35%", fontSize: "20px"}}>SwimDiary is an Aquatic Exercising application targeted for post-college athletes looking to maintain good physical habits. Figuring out a training plan in the pool can be intimidating without assistance, as we all know too well.</p>
            
            <p style={{backgroundColor: "#aeafb6", marginLeft: "62%", maxWidth: "35%", fontSize: "20px"}}>Whether it be targeting a specific upcoming meet you want to perform well at, or filling in your lunch-break with an hour of structured aerobic swimming, SwimDiary is the home-base to all of your aquatic goals.</p>  

            <p style={{backgroundColor: "#0a10e8", marginLeft: "3%", maxWidth: "35%", fontSize: "20px"}}>Founders Nicholas Bustamante and Daniel McArthur were college athletes who discovered, along with many of their peers, that structured aquatic-exercise after graduating college was only available in the form of Masters programs. Not only is this inconvenient for scheduling purposes, these programs are often generic and don't allow for getting in racing shape for upcoming competitions.</p>

            <p style={{backgroundColor: "#aeafb6", marginLeft: "62%", maxWidth: "35%", fontSize: "20px"}}>SwimDiary changes that. Not only can you create training blocks for specific periods of time, new workouts are available weekly on the app, freeing you to train the way you want, wherever you want!</p>
